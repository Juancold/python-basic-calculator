Basic Python Calculator
This is a terminal-based calculator built with Python to practice fundamental programming concepts.

 What I practiced:
Variables & Data Types: Handling float and string inputs.

Conditional Logic: Using if, elif, and else to control the program flow.

Error Handling: Implementing a check to prevent division by zero.

Functions: Organizing the code within a reusable def function.


*Code comments and interface are in Portuguese. Future projects will be documented in English.
